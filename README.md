### Object Detection with YOLO

### Deadline
Monday 4/3/2023 11:59 PM CST


### Description
In this assignment, you will apply a YOLOv3 model for object detection on images using Keras. Please follow the steps described in the article [1]. 

### Tasks
The specific steps for this task are:
1.	Download and save the pre-trained model weights.
2.	Create the YOLOv3 model.
3.	Make a prediction on three images of your choice (e.g., images of people, animals, objects etc.) and report the model’s output.
4.	What is the purpose of the non-max suppression?
5.	You notice that the non-max suppression of the model is 0.5. Please repeat step 3 using the following values for non-max suppression: (i) 0.3, and (ii) 0.8. What do you observe?
