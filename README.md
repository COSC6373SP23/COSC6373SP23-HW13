### Description
In this assignment, you will use Convolutional Autoencoders to detect anomalies in images. For the purposes of this assignment, you will use the Flowers Recognition dataset [1]. The dataset contains 4,242 images of five categories of flowers: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip. 

### Tasks
The specific steps for this task are:
1.	Create a Convolutional Autoencoder as described in this article [2].
2.	Train your Autoencoder on the sunflower images (feel free to use a split of your choice). Output the same examples of the original vs. reconstructed images.
3.	Evaluate your Autoencoder to each one of the other flower types to detect anomalies and find the MSE between the normal and anomalous images.
4.	Output the distribution of density scores among training, validation, and anomalies for each flower type [2].
5.	How does the autoencoder work for anomaly detection?
6.	What other methods can be used instead of anomaly detection?

### Submission Guideline
This assignment is done individually, you can share and discuss ideas but you must submit your own code.

1.	Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one).
2.	Open GitHub link from homework pdf file.
3.	Select your name and accept the invitation.
4.	Submit your working code in GitHub (.py or .ipynb files)
5.	Upload any .zip file or folder if your code refers to the paths of those files.
6.	Update the README.md file with instructions on how to run your code.
7.	A pdf of your report (name: COSC6373S23-HW12-ICA-Report-Firstname-Lastname.pdf) with your output and comments.
